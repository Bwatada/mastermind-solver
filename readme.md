# README: mastermind-solver

## About

This is a short script meant to help you solve mastermind games. 
You first start the program, specify the number of colors there are, and the number of holes
available. You then tell the program the number of red and white pegs you recieved, and 
it'll give you a combination to guess.

Just for kicks, I'm writing a version of the algorithm in several different programming 
languages. Versions available:

*   Python (reference implementation):
    *   Basic console app
    *   Finished
*   HTML5 + Javascript webapp: 
    *   Demo located at: http://projects.michael0x2a.com/mastermind_solver
    *   Complete, but undergoing refactoring to be more idiomatic.
